            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas seuerall complaints haue beene heretofore made, as well</hi> vnto Our late deare and Royall Father, King <hi>IAMES</hi> of euer bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed memory, in his life time, and vnto Vs since Our accesse to the Crowne, as vnto the Lords and others of Our Priuie Councell, and to diuers of Our Iustices of Assize in their Circuits, and Iustices of Peace of sundry Counties of this Our Realme at their Sessions, of the great abuses, deceipts, and falsities, frequently vsed by and among Weauers, Combers, Spinsters, and other Workers and Makers of Woollen Cloth and Yarne, by the dayly falsifying their Yarne, as well in the length of the Reele-staffe, as in the number of the threds, and of the differences growne among themselues, concerning a constant Reele for the reeling of Yarne to be kept, and for the increase of the wages for the Poore, according to the Statutes of <hi>quinto Eliz.</hi> and <hi>primo Iacobi;</hi> For remedy and reformation whereof, and for setling of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant course for the said Reele, and increase of the Poores wages, it hath beene vpon great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice thought fit, that the said course of keeping of a constant Reele throughout all the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Counties of this Our Realme of <hi>England,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales;</hi> and the increase of the wages for the Poore, might proceed and goe on for the generall good of the whole Common Wealth: And that in regard the Reel-staffe had beene lately increased a fifth or sixth part lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then had beene accustomed, all Spinsters should haue for the Spinning and Reeling of fixe double Knots on the double Reele, or twelue on the single Reele, a peny, which is more by two pence in the shilling then formerly they haue had: And that all Labourers and other Artificers imployed about the Trade of Clothing and Yarne-making, should haue the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trease of wages. And for establishing the same, Wee haue by Our Letters Patents, bearing date the two and twentieth day of Ianuary now last past, for Vs, Our Heires, and Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, willed, ordained, and appointed, as well for auoiding of all future deceit in making of
<pb facs="tcp:185788:2"/>Cloth and Yarne, and for preseruation of peace betweene Buyer and Seller, Worke-master and Seruant; And all Clothiers, Weauers, Combers, Spinsters, and other Workers and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Cloth and Yarne, either Woollen or Linnen, within this Our Realme of <hi>England</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> that there be a constant Reele prouided and kept by all and euery Clothier, Weauer, Comber, Spinster, and other workers and makers of Cloth and Yarne, either Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len or Linen, within all and euery the Counties of this Our Realme of <hi>England</hi> and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Wales,</hi> and in all Cities, Boroughs, and Townes Corporate, and other places, where the making of Cloth or Yarne, either Linnen or Woollen is vsed, the said Reele to be called a Cloth-Reele, or Reele-staffe, and to be of one yard about the single Reele, and two yards or two elles about the double Reele, euery Knot containing fourescore threds, for all Yarne whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, both Woollen and Linnen, the same to be kept and continued as a constant Reele betweene Buyer and Seller, Work master and Seruant, whereby the truth of the same may appeare to all persons trading in Cloth or Yarne; The surueying, searching, sealing, and ouersight where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as of the increase of the wages of the poore, We haue by Our said Letters Patents commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and appointed vnto Our well beloued Seruant, <hi>Iohn Etherington,</hi> one of the Yeomen of Our Chamber, and to <hi>Henry Stracey,</hi> for the tearme of one and thirty yeeres, with the like Fees and Allowances for the same their seruice, as the Clarke of the Market of Our Houshold hath for weights and measures; A Schedule whereof is hereunto annexed; And that they attend their said seruice but once a yeare, as the Clarke of the Market doth, and that they and the said Clarke of the Market do trauell and sit together, as shall be most commodious for themselues, and the good and ease of the Commons; As by Our said Letters Patents more at large appeareth.</p>
            <p>All which We doe by this Our Royall Proclamation ratifie and confirme; and doe strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enioyne, require and command, all Our louing Subiects whatsoeuer, whom the same shall or may concerne, That they carefully and diligently obserue the same, and bee obedient and conformeable thereunto; And that all Clothiers, Weauers, Combers, Spinsters, and other person and persons working or making of Cloth or Yarne, either Woollen or Linen, doe from henceforth prouide and keepe a constant Reele, or Reel-staffe, according to the contents of Our said Letters Patents; And that the Poore, imployed about the making of Cloth and Yarne, haue the said increase of Wages, after the rate of two pence in the shilling, more then heretofore they haue had paid &amp; continued vnto them. And whereas also by the Lawes &amp; Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of this Our Realme of <hi>England,</hi> there should be one Weight and one Measure thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Realme, whereof Our said late deare Father King <hi>IAMES,</hi> in His great wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, piety and iustice, by His Royall Proclamation, dated the second day of February, in the sixteenth yeere of His Reigne, did admonish His then Subiects of this Kingdome; Yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse we are informed that the same hath wrought little or no Reformation, but that there are at this day frequently vsed in the Cities, Boroughs, Townes Corporate, and in many other Market Townes, Parishes, Villages, and in other places of this Our Realme, especially in the Northerne and Westerne parts, and in Our Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Counties Palatine of <hi>Lancaster</hi> and <hi>Durham,</hi> false and deceitfull Weights and Measurts of different contents one from another, and all disagreeing from Our Standard appointed to bee the rule and direction for them.</p>
            <p>And whereas Wee are also informed, that many vnconscionable persons within this Our Realme of <hi>England,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> haue and doe vse seuerall Weights and Measures, with the greater to buy, and with the lesser to sell, and doe also vse false &amp; deceitfull Beames and Ballances, to the great losse and defrauding of Our Subiects, and especially of the poorer sort, who are most sensible of the same: And whereas the Clarke of Our Market, by the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme, ought by his Office to enquire of the said abuses, and punish and reforme the same; and ought also to set reasonable and indifferent rates and prizes vpon Victuall and other Prouisions, chiefly in times of Our Progresse, and to foresee that the same be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and of good condition and quality in their seuerall sorts; and ought also to inflict as well Pecuniarie as Corporall punishment vpon the Offendors, according to the seuerall qualities and degrees of their offences: And whereas complaint hath beene made vnto Vs, of the great negligence vsed in the execution of the said Office, partly for that diuers which are trusted as Deputies to execute the same, haue beene hitherto ignorant what their power and authority is, and partly because diuers of them haue beene very carelesse and remisse, and respecting onely
<pb facs="tcp:185788:3"/>their owne priuate gaines, extort vniust Fees, and either for fauour or reward spare the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendors, and neglect the publike seruice wherewith they are trusted:</p>
            <p>We therefore hauing taken the Premisses into consideration, and foreseeing how much the plenty of this Realme might be increased, and the frauds and abuses now generally vsed in buying and selling (especially by Inne-keepers and Victuallers) might bee suppressed, if the Clarke of Our Market by himselfe, or by honest and discreet Deputies did diligently and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully intend the execution of the said Office: And We desiring nothing more, (after the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of true Religion, and the seruice of Almighty God) then by all good meanes to further and aduance the peace and plenty of Our louing Subiects: And minding also to prouide that the poore Labourers, and indigent Spinsters, and other Artificers imployed in and about the Trade of Clothing, may be duly answered the increase of their Wages, after the aforesaid rate of two pence in the shilling; Haue thought fit by this Our Royall Proclamation, to publish and make knowne to all Our louing Subiects, as well what by the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme, should and ought to be performed by the Clarke of Our Market and his Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as by the said <hi>Iohn Ethrington</hi> and <hi>Henry Stracey,</hi> their Executors and Assignes, and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, and euery of them respectiuely, as what Fees they may iustly require and take, and what courses they should hold for the better execution of their seruices, and what account Wee expect, and haue determined to require at their hands concerning these seruices hereafter. Wee do therfore hereby signifie and declare, that the Office of the Clark of Our Market, (being a very ancient Office of Our Crowne) by the Lawes and Statutes of this Our Realme, is to inquire of all abuses in Weights, Beames, Ballances, and Measures; and also to enquire of all falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, deceits and abuses in the Trades of Millers, Bakers, Brewers, Vintners, Inne-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. Alehouse-keepers, Cookes, Victuallers, Fishmongers, Butchers, Chandlors, Grocers, Mercers, Clothiers, Clothworkers, Weauers, Taylors, Brokers, Tanners, Shooma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, Smithes, Glouers, Whitetawers, Maulsters, Corne-masters, Colliers, Woodmongers, and generally all other Artificers, Tradesmen and other persons whatsoeuer, hauing or vsing Weights and Measures, inhabiting wheresoeuer within Our said Realme, or Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> as well to preuent deceipts and frauds, as to punish the same; And also to search and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that all Victuals, and other things put to sale by them, for the sustenance or vse of mans body, and all prouisions for their horses or their Cattell, be wholsome and of good qualitie; and that their Manufactures be well and workmanlike made and wrought, and that they sell at and for reasonable and moderate gaines, and not at vnreasonable and excessiue prizes: And especially to inquire of, and punish all Forestallers, Ingrossers, and Regrators, who by their inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate desire of gaine, doe inhance the prices of all things vendible, to the decay of all publike and open Markets, and the hinderance of all Traffique and Commerce betweene man and man.</p>
            <p>And to the intent that the Clarke of Our Market may put in due execution that power, which by the Law is giuen vnto him, for the furtherance of Our seruice, and the seruice of the Common Wealth, We do will &amp; straitly command, that the said Clarke of Our Market, and his Deputies, doe from henceforth with all diligence execute the said Office in all places, as well within the Verge, in the times of Our Progresse, that Our Nobles, Seruants, Traine, and Suitors, attending vpon Our Person and Court, may be well and honestly vsed and demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as in all other parts &amp; places of this Our Realme of <hi>England</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales;</hi> And that from henceforth he keepe his Sessions by himselfe, or his sufficient Deputie, or Deputies, once in euery yeere at the least, in the seuerall Counties of this Our Realme, and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> and in as many places in euery Countie, as shall bee most conuenient for the generall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the seruice and ease of Our people, and that he or they giue knowledge in writing, of the times and places when and where their Sessions shall be held, by Precept vnder Our Seale of the said Office, to bee directed to the high Constables within the circuit of the Sessions, a conuenient time before such Sessions are to be held, and that one or more of the Iustices of the Peace of the County, inhabiting within the circuit of that Sessions, may vpon reasonable no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice be present at euery Sessions, the better to assist the Clarke of the Market, and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, and to see Iustice equally and indifferently administred, and that the Clarke of Our Market, and his Deputies, doe diligently enquire, by the Oathes of twelue men at the least, to be impannelled, returned, and sworne by him or them in such manner, as hath anciently beene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
